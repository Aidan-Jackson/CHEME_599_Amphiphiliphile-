# CHEME_599_Amphiphiliphile-

The purpose of this project is to distinguish aqueous from oil phase droplets, along with "lenses" where one type of droplet may be formed over the other. The two goals of the project will be to count the number of each type of droplet and quantify their brightness over time.
